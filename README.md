This is a cafe menu program done in Ruby.
Run the menu_choice.rb program.
It starts by asking the time of day in order to pick the correct menu.
Once you have chosen your menu items, it totals you bill and asks about a tip.
If you choose a tip, you can leave a flat amount or a percentage tip.
It then itemizes your bill and leaves you with a total and a pleasant farewell.
